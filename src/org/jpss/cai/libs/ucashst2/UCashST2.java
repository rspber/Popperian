//Powerful CACHE pascal class by Joao Paulo Schwarz Schuler
//
//This unit is used to store a memory structure where the key (index) is an
//array of bytes and the data is an array of byte.
//The class CacheMem is designed to be used as CACHE memory provider.
//
//Given that the index is an array of bytes, the index is sometimes called STATE or just ST.
//
//What is it called Cash ST2? Who knows... Does it make cash?

// maximum number of states to be cached
	public final static int MaxStates = 400000;
// type of key and data in the memory.
//	byte[]
	// [ValueTODO] TProcPred = TODO(procedure)
// This class represents an array such as "Memory[array of byte] maps into array of byte".
